Roguelike work

2/6/2015
This is kinda a mess. 
Using <a href="http://tapiov.net/rlutil/">rlutil</a> (as per <a href="http://tapiov.net/rlutil/docs/License.txt">the license</a>) as a starting point for primitive console put & color functions - also because it is drop dead easy using a header include than it is linking against a more robust library.

- rlutil uses 1,1 as the top-left index - I prefer 0,0
- rlutil uses column, row notation - of course, I prefer row, column
